0x0F-load_balancer

This projects sets up all my three servers with Nginx and installs a load balancer. The second server is set to be identical to the first but can be differentiated by their respective HTTP header, while I install HAproxy on the third server(load balancer server)

Using:
Ubuntu 20.04,
Bash Scripts
